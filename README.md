The Note Keeper App is a project designed to allow users to manage their notes effectively. With a 
simple and intuitive interface, users can easily add new notes, view existing ones, and delete those 
they no longer need. The application is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies.
 On the frontend, React.js is used to create the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.
 Meanwhile, the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing the necessary APIs for 
handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the notes. MongoDB serves as the database,
 ensuring data persistence and reliability.

Integration between the frontend and backend is achieved through RESTful APIs. When a user 
interacts with the frontend, such as adding or deleting a note, Axios is used to send HTTP requests 
to the backend API endpoints. These endpoints process the requests and interact with the MongoDB database
 accordingly, ensuring that changes made by the user are reflected and stored persistently. This seamless
 integration allows for a smooth user experience, with data remaining available even after refreshing the page.

I'd like to express my gratitude to the TAs of the class, whose instructional videos and resources were 
invaluable in guiding me through the integration of backend and frontend technologies. Their guidance 
helped me overcome challenges and implement a robust solution for the Note Keeper App.
